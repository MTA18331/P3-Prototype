These are the important things to know when using the program:

The project needs the following libraries: pygame, opencv2, numpy, time, threading and Queue
The project was made using Pycharm and Python 3.
The main file to open the project is "UIMain.py".
In order for the system to recognises a sign, a green glove is needed on your left hand. 
The system recognises input for signs of the numbers 1-5.
